## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets tqdm
```

## Hardware:
-GPU: Recommended NVIDIA RTX 3050 (great for fine-tuning with limited VRAM)\
-Environment: Google Colab for easy setup and execution\
## üìö Dataset
This project uses a small subset of the OpenWebText dataset, which contains high-quality text data scraped from various sources across the web.

## üöÄ How It Works
*Loading the Model*\
We start by loading the GPT-Neo 1.3B model and tokenizer from the Hugging Face Model Hub. The model is initialized with FP16 precision to optimize memory usage.

*Fine-Tuning the Model*\
The model is fine-tuned using the AdamW optimizer and gradient accumulation. This allows us to train with smaller batch sizes and efficiently handle limited GPU memory.

*Calculating Perplexity*\
We calculate the perplexity before and after fine-tuning. Perplexity is an important metric for text generation, where lower perplexity indicates better performance in generating coherent text.

*Training Loop*\
The fine-tuning loop processes the data in batches (batch size = 1) and uses gradient accumulation to improve training efficiency, especially with smaller GPUs.

## üí• **Output Example**
Once the fine-tuning process is complete, you'll see an output similar to this:

üìå Perplexity Before Fine-Tuning: 38.1234\
‚úÖ Perplexity After Fine-Tuning: 25.5678


This indicates a significant improvement in model performance, as the perplexity has decreased!

## ‚ö° **Optimizing for RTX 3050**
The FP16 precision optimization allows this model to be fine-tuned on an RTX 3050 GPU, ensuring that the VRAM usage is minimized. By using gradient accumulation, we efficiently train the model with small batch sizes while maintaining performance.

## üöÄ **Running in Google Colab**
This project is designed to be run in Google Colab for easy cloud-based execution. Simply upload the notebook and execute the code without requiring complex setup.

## üéØ **Results**
After fine-tuning the model, you will notice a reduction in perplexity, which means that the model is generating more coherent and accurate text. This is a direct result of the fine-tuning process, improving the text generation quality.
